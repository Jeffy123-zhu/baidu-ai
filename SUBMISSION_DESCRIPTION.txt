MediDoc AI - Intelligent Medical Document Analysis & Multi-Agent Diagnostic Assistant System

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROJECT OVERVIEW
════════════════

MediDoc AI is a comprehensive end-to-end medical intelligence system that 
revolutionizes healthcare documentation and diagnosis through the integration 
of advanced OCR technology, multi-agent AI collaboration, and edge-cloud 
hybrid deployment.

The system addresses three critical pain points in modern healthcare:
1. Low document processing efficiency (doctors spend hours on paperwork)
2. Limited diagnostic capabilities in rural areas (lack of specialist access)
3. Privacy vs. speed trade-off (cloud processing concerns)
